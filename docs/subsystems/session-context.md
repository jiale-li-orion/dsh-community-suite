# Session Context

English | [中文](session-context.zh.md)

The current model-visible Session surface as an inspectable and replaceable product capability. [`@deepseek-ai/dsh-session-context`](../../packages/session/session-context) owns the Host service and Remote types; the [implemented decision](../../.agents/notes/implemented/feature/2026-08-16-session-context-management.md) owns why Chat, Context, and Trajectory remain separate projections.

## Current units and snapshots

```ts type-equiv
/** Bounded metadata for one indivisible current-surface unit. */
interface ContextUnit {
  readonly id: ContextUnitId
  readonly startSeq: number
  readonly endSeq: number
  readonly kind: ContextUnitKind
  readonly role: ContextUnitRole
  readonly tokenCount: number
  readonly preview: string
  readonly time: number
  readonly balanced: boolean
  readonly editable: boolean
  readonly checkpointId?: CompactionId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Current durable model-surface snapshot for one live Agent. */
interface ContextSnapshot {
  readonly sessionId: SessionId
  readonly logRevision: number
  readonly replaceGeneration: number
  readonly generationSeq: number | null
  readonly tailSeq: number | null
  readonly totalTokens: number
  readonly surfaceTokens: number
  readonly route?: { readonly provider: string; readonly model: string }
  readonly unitCount: number
  readonly unitOffset: number
  readonly hasEarlierUnits: boolean
  readonly units: readonly ContextUnit[]
  readonly preparations: readonly ContextPreparation[]
}
```

Units follow current surface order and end only at tool-balanced cuts. `unitOffset` is the first returned unit's stable position in this snapshot; an earlier page can prepend only while generation identity and interval adjacency still match.

## Reviewed preparation

```ts type-equiv
/** Review-facing projection of one durable range compaction preparation. */
interface ContextPreparation {
  readonly preparationId: CompactionPreparationId
  readonly status: ContextPreparationStatus
  readonly startSeq: number
  readonly endSeq: number
  readonly unitCount: number
  readonly shadowedTokenCount: number
  readonly preservationBrief?: string
  readonly summary: string
  readonly summarySource: 'generated' | 'human' | 'model'
  readonly plan?: CompactionPreparationPlan
  readonly attemptedCalls?: number
  readonly completedCalls: number
  readonly chunkCount: number
  readonly createdAt: number
  readonly error?: string
  readonly compactionId?: CompactionId
}
```

`preparing` and `ready` leave the current surface unchanged. The optional plan reports the exact summarization route, direct or map/reduce strategy, context and input budgets, and output cap; `attemptedCalls` is absent only for older records that predate durable attempts. `committing` begins with the standard compaction lock; `committed` correlates the resulting checkpoint. A failed provider preparation or bracket close remains a durable failed record.

## Same-Session rewrite

```ts type-equiv
/** Structured same-Session rewrite request from UI or another trusted consumer. */
interface ContextRewriteRequest {
  readonly unitId: ContextUnitId
  readonly expectedTailSeq: number
  readonly mode: ContextRewriteMode
  /** Replacement prose; the Host retains image blocks from the selected current message. */
  readonly text: string
  readonly continue: boolean
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Committed rewrite result. */
interface ContextRewriteResult {
  readonly rewriteId: ContextRewriteId
  readonly replacementSeq: number
  readonly previousGenerationSeq: number | null
  readonly shadowedItemCount: number
  readonly shadowedTokenCount: number
  readonly contextRunId?: ContextRunId
}
```

`edit-and-continue` replaces the selected unit through the loaded tail. `patch` replaces one balanced unit. The Host validates the unit, tail, edit authority, and image retention before append; `continue` requests a separate durable context run after flush.

## Checkpoint recall

```ts type-equiv
/** One canonical fragment of an original model-visible message. */
interface ContextHistoryEntry {
  readonly checkpointId: CompactionId
  readonly seq: number
  readonly role: 'user' | 'assistant'
  /** UTF-16 offset in the canonical serialized message. */
  readonly offset: number
  readonly text: string
  readonly complete: boolean
  readonly nestedCheckpointId?: CompactionId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Bounded checkpoint-original page. */
interface ContextHistoryReadResult {
  readonly entries: readonly ContextHistoryEntry[]
  readonly nextCursor?: ContextHistoryCursor
  readonly complete: boolean
  readonly returnedBytes: number
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** One checkpoint-addressed literal match. */
interface ContextHistorySearchMatch {
  readonly checkpointId: CompactionId
  readonly seq: number
  /** UTF-16 offset in the canonical serialized message. */
  readonly offset: number
  readonly snippet: string
  readonly nestedCheckpointId?: CompactionId
}
```

```ts type-equiv
/** Bounded literal-search page. */
interface ContextHistorySearchResult {
  readonly matches: readonly ContextHistorySearchMatch[]
  readonly nextCursor?: ContextHistoryCursor
  readonly complete: boolean
  readonly scannedBytes: number
}
```

Recall follows `compaction/summary.shadowedSeqs`, with optional recursive entry into checkpoint replacement messages. Read cursors bind the checkpoint and recursion mode; search cursors additionally bind the literal query and case mode. The complete read response is byte-bounded, and search reports scanned original bytes rather than response size.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (verified fresh by `pnpm run verify-cordis-catalog` in doc-sync; regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — this section is byte-identical in both language sides of the page. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).
